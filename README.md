# Marknote

Marknote is a simple command line tool for importing markdown notes into Evernote
for free on Mac devices. Current version lacks flexibility and proper documentation
because it's written for personal use in less than a quarter hour, but I will try
to improve it in the future.

**The Current version only imports notes to the pre-created *Buffer* notebook.**

## TODO

- Add flags for setting title, notebook, and tags
- Implement a watch system for automatically saving file changes in Evernote
- Add documentation for easier installation and usage

This tool is built on top of [BlackFriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday),
[Mack](https://github.com/everdev/mack) and of course [Evernote AppleScript API](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/applescript.php).
